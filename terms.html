                    Welcome to SafeGuard Pest Control. By using our services, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please review them carefully.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Service Agreement</h2>
                <p>
                    When you schedule a pest control service with SafeGuard Pest Control, you enter into a service agreement. This agreement becomes effective upon your acceptance of our written service proposal or estimate, or upon the commencement of service, whichever occurs first.
                </p>

                <h3>1.1 Scope of Services</h3>
                <p>
                    SafeGuard Pest Control will provide pest control services as described in your service agreement. Services may include inspection, treatment, monitoring, and follow-up visits as specified in your chosen service plan. We reserve the right to modify treatment methods based on professional judgment and regulatory requirements.
                </p>

                <h3>1.2 Service Limitations</h3>
                <p>
                    Our services are designed to control and reduce pest populations to acceptable levels. While we use proven methods and professional-grade products, we cannot guarantee complete elimination of all pests in all situations. Environmental factors, structural conditions, and customer cooperation all affect treatment outcomes.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Payment Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    Payment is due at the time of service unless other arrangements have been made in writing. We accept cash, checks, and major credit cards. For recurring service plans, payment may be scheduled on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis as agreed.
                </p>

                <h3>2.1 Pricing and Fees</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initial service fees are based on property size, pest type, and infestation severity</li>
                    <li>Recurring maintenance fees are outlined in your service plan agreement</li>
                    <li>Emergency or same-day services may include additional fees</li>
                    <li>Prices are subject to change with 30 days' written notice for existing customers</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 Late Payment</h3>
                <p>
                    Accounts not paid within 30 days may be subject to a late fee of 1.5% per month (18% annual percentage rate). We reserve the right to suspend services for accounts more than 30 days past due.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Cancellation and Refund Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    We want you to be completely satisfied with our services. Our cancellation and refund policies are designed to be fair to both parties.
                </p>

                <h3>3.1 Appointment Cancellations</h3>

                    <li>No-shows or refused entry: May incur the full service fee</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.2 Service Plan Cancellations</h3>
                <p>
                    Monthly service plans may be cancelled with 30 days' written notice. Annual plans may be subject to early termination fees as outlined in your service agreement. Refunds for prepaid services will be prorated based on services already rendered.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3 Satisfaction Guarantee</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are not satisfied with our service, please contact us within 30 days. We will re-service your property at no additional charge. If the problem persists after re-treatment, we will refund your most recent service payment.
                </p>
